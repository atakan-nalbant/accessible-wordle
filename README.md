# Make Wordle Accessible

The popular game Wordle, found at https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/,
is unfortunately not accessible to screen reader users. This is a tiny
script to fix it and make it accessible.

Chrome extension coming soon, pending review. In the meantime there are
instructions for how to install a bookmarklet here:
