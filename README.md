The popular game Wordle, found at https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html
is unfortunately not accessible to screen reader users. This is a tiny
script to fix it and make it accessible.

If you're using Chrome on the desktop (Mac, PC, Linux),
install this Chrome extension to make Wordle accessible to your screen reader:
