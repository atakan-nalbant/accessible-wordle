      This is a little bookmarklet to make Wordle accessible to screen
      reader users. It's not a replacement for the game, rather you can
      use it to modify Wordle in-place to make it accessible - that way
      you can play the same game as everyone else.

      It's a few steps to set up, unfortunately. A Chrome extension is
      coming, but whlie that's still under review, this is the only way
      to modify a website in-place.

      Below is a link called Make Wordle Accessible. Instead of clicking
      the link, right-click it and choose Copy.
